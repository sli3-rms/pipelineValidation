# Definition of artifact targets that exist 
# in this repo
# (required)
artifacts: 
  -
    name: "rest-api"
    deployable: false
    build_targets: 
      - "jar"
  -
    name: "rest-service"
    deployable: true
    build_targets: 
      - "jar"
      - "docker"

# Optional "targets" node. This will
# be necessary in order to potentially 
# deliver multiple targets from one repo 
# independently (e.g. a library needs to be
# versioned independently or a grouping of 
# artifacts go together even though they live 
# in teh same repo). The default is a single 
# target named "default" that simply includes
# the existing artifacts in the order defined
# these may translate (for example), into distinct 
# jenkins jobs that could be triggered

# (optional)
